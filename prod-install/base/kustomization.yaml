# This will bring up the main trow pod and a service that routes to it. 
#
# A working install will require an ingress forwarding a (sub)domain you control to this service.
# This install assumes the ingress terminates TLS; internally Trow is running over http only.
#
# The overlay directories include examples of how to provision ingress on various types of
# Kubernetes cluster.
