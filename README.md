# Trow
Distributed Cluster Registry

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ContainerSolutions/lycaon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ContainerSolutions/lycaon)

We're building a cluster-first registry for Kubernetes (and possibly other orchestrators).

### Why "Trow"

"Trow" is a word with multiple, divergent meanings. In Shetland folklore a trow
is a small, mischevious creature, similar to the Scandanavian troll. In England,
it is a old sytle of cargo boat that transported goods on rivers. Finally, it is
an archaic word meaning "to think, believe, or trust". The reader is free to
choose which interpretation they like most, but it should be pronounced to rhyme
with "cow".
