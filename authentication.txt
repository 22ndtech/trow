* Authentication in Trow
An implementation of the Open Authorization standard.

no url - passes Welcome message
/v2/ url - sends the www.authenticate response
/login/ - reads the basic token and returns a bearer token
all subsequent urls check bearer token

At the moment takes a base64 encoded user/pass combination and checks it against hard coded values. If credentials are valid a bearer token is returned.

TODO

Need other methods of input rather than just base 64 encoded credentials.
Need better than a hardcoded username / password combination. Interim configurable user/pass. Medium term password file. Long term full blown OAuth implementation.
