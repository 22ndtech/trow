Welcome to Trow:

Setup your DNS to point at Trow

If you are running Trow on http, there will need to be a TLS ingress in front of it as Trow needs to be run over TLS.
Please see the examples found on the docs at https://github.com/ContainerSolutions/trow/blob/master/docs/HELM_INSTALL.md

To test you can run and login with the credentials for {{ .Values.trow.user }}

$ docker login https://{{ .Values.trow.domain }}
